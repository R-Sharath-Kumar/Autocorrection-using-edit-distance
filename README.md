# Autocorrection-using-edit-distance
Corpus - https://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm There many other books available for free on the website and in many different formats

* Used the corpus to write an auto-correct function that corrects words one or two edit distances away from the wrongly spelt word. 
* The measure of similarity between two words was calculated using the Levenshtein distance metric
* I got the idea for this from a course from the NLP specialisation on Coursera (deeplearning.ai) and the idea we used here is from this article (https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) by Peter Norvig (2007)
